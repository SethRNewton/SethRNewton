## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Seth Newton and I am a cheminformatics data scientist. As most of my work has been with the federal government, I cannot post the code here. 

Nevertheless, here are some repositories of personal projects I'd like to direct you to that showcase my skills:
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/SethRNewton/Recurrent-Neural-Network-for-Generating-Novel-Baby-Boy-Names">Recurrent Neural Network to Generate Novel Boy Names</a> - popular baby boy names were fed into a recurrent neural network that works at the character level to predict novel boy names. It generated some interesting names!</li>
  <li><a href = "https://github.com/SethRNewton/Unsupervised-Learning-to-Categorize-Stock-News-Headlines">Unsupervised Learning to Categorize Stock Headlines</a> - here I use unsupervised learning techniques to cluster stock news headlines, finding that one cluster contains more editorial/opinion type articles compared to reports on actual company events</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/SethRNewton/Machine-Learning-to-Understand-Stock-News">Supervised Learning to Predict Stock Movements Based on Headlines</a> - after classification of news headlines using unsupervised learning, I use sentiment analysis of event-driven headlines fed into a support vector machines model and a random forest model to classify news headlines into those likely to cause a positive price movement, negative movement, or unlikely to cause any movement</li>
  
</ol>
